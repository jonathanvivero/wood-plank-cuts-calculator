# Wood Plank Cuts Calculator
A wood plank cuts calculator for carpenters and DIY projects

I'm an amateur carpenter, maker, DIYer, and make-it-with-my-own-hands lover. Sometimes I need wood for my furniture, in custom measurements, so commercial pieces are not an option. 

The solution is buying an "industrial" size plank  and requesting some cuts to get your customized wood panels to build your project. 

This application allows to set some parameters to get the breakdown of the resulting frames. The parameters are:
- Plank size (Height, Width, Thickness)
- Cut width (saw blade width)
- Minimal security meassure. Under this measure, the cut won't be done. e.g. Leroy Merlin (Spain) has a minimum of 230 mm, so is not possible to get a piece of 220mm x 500mm.
- Calculate splitting cut. This means that the app must take into account to group the panels so it could be a in a side of the group of panels that split the plank in 2 parts.
  
Then, the user add the size of each panel and automatically calculate the breakdown
